# Diabetes-Disease-Analysis-ML

📝 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze diabetes data using machine learning techniques. The dataset is explored, preprocessed, 
and used to train multiple models to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various health features.

📊 Dataset Information

🔹 Dataset Name: Diabetes.csv

🔹 Number of Columns: 9

🔹 Features Used in Analysis:

Pregnancies - Number of times pregnant

Glucose - Blood glucose level

BloodPressure - Blood pressure level

SkinThickness - Skin thickness measurement

Insulin - Insulin level

BMI - Body Mass Index

DiabetesPedigreeFunction - Genetic risk factor for diabetes

Age - Patient’s age

Outcome - 0 (Not Diabetic) or 1 (Diabetic)

🔹 Handling Missing Values:

Zero values were replaced with NaN

Missing values were imputed using the median for better accuracy

🔹 Initial Data Analysis:


describe() was used to obtain statistical summaries of the dataset

info() was used to examine the structure of the dataset

🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

Several algorithms were applied to predict diabetes based on the available data:


✅ Random Forest Classifier - Used for pattern recognition and decision-making through multiple trees

✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM) - Used to separate data and improve prediction accuracy

✅ Extra Trees Classifier - Additional model for better stability and performance

📌 Technologies & Tools Used

🛠 Data Analysis & Visualization:


Pandas - For data manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn - For data visualization

🛠 Machine Learning & Model Evaluation:

Scikit-learn - For training and evaluating models

✨ Project Outcomes

📌 Comprehensive analysis of health data for diabetic and non-diabetic individuals

📌 Machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes

📌 Performance comparison of different models to select the best one
